Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming Room is a game development company that is looking to distribute their game Draw It or Lose It across multiple platforms. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- Following through each issue needing to be looked at in the problems section as well as looking through the resources given were the main ways I went about developing the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would mainly want to focus on the design document itself where I could reccomend more specific pros and cons between the OS' and methods for cross-compatibility.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- The User in this case was looking for a game where there could be multiple teams with multiple players with multiple games going on all at once, so having the program allow multiple/unique entities to exist at once was necessary.
- It's important to follow the needs of the user when designing as they are the ones who are going to use the product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- We used UML diagrams and software design documents for this approach. In the future when facing similar projects, I will want to use visual documentation like UML to help
  visualize the planned architecture of the program. I would also want to use documentation that lays out the projects goals (be it mine or a clients), and how those goals might be met and the problems we might face, weighing pros and cons.
